# 📸 Photo Spot Quiz Travel

A SwiftUI + CoreML-based mobile app to enhance group travel experiences through **photo spot quizzes**, emotion tracking, and user engagement analytics.

## 🧪 Overview

This app was developed as part of a university research project aiming to investigate how **group communication** affects emotional states during travel. Users work together in teams to find secret "photo spots" in real-world tourist areas like **Kyoto**, and their engagement is tracked via heart rate (Apple Watch), surveys, and app interaction.

## 🎯 Objective

To explore whether:
- Group-based quiz activity can increase **positive emotion and engagement** during travel.
- Emotion data (heart rate, feedback) can offer insights into **user experience** in tourism contexts.

## 💡 Features

- 🗺️ Group destination selection with photo spot missions  
- 📷 Spot Quiz system using cropped images & CoreML classification  
- ⌚ Apple Watch integration to collect heart rate data during exploration  
- 📝 Google Form integration for in-spot and post-spot surveys  
- 📈 UX evaluation through visual, physiological, and behavioral data  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **SwiftUI / Swift**
- **Create ML / CoreML**
- **Apple Watch integration (HealthKit)**
- **Django backend (for data storage & analysis)**
- **GitHub + Git LFS (for code & model management)**
